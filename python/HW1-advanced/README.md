**Task Advanced: Create a Password Generator for Linux Users**

Your task is to create a password generator program using Python specifically designed for Linux users. The program should generate strong and secure passwords that can be used for user accounts on Linux systems.

**Requirements:**

_Prompt the user to enter the desired length for the password_.
_Generate a random password consisting of a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters._
_Ensure that the generated password meets the following criteria:_
- Contains at least one uppercase letter
- Contains at least one lowercase letter
- Contains at least one number
- Contains at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, etc.)
- Display the generated password to the user.


Example Output:

```bash
Welcome to the Linux User Password Generator!

Please enter the desired password length: 12

Generated password: 3@5uJ9#p1L$w
```

Note:

_You can utilize the random module in Python to generate random characters and build the password._
_Consider using the string module in Python to access sets of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters)._
_Make sure to include clear instructions and error handling for invalid input._
